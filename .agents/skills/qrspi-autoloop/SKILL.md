# QRSPI Autoloop

## When to use

Use when a `./.qrspi/<feature>/` workspace has an approved spec and plan and you want unattended execution. For human-gated execution, use `qrspi-workflow` or `qrspi-implement`.

Read [the runtime contract](references/runtime.md) before running this step. Skill names such as `qrspi-query` identify portable skills; in Codex, invoke them as `$qrspi-query`.

## Core Philosophy
- Spawn and track; never implement or review in this conversation
- One repair attempt per phase, then a human

This skill is part of the QRSPI workflow and is normally invoked by `qrspi-workflow`. It may also be invoked directly. Unlike the interactive skills, it requires the helper and cannot fall back to artifact-only mode.

## What this is

Autoloop is the unattended sibling of `qrspi-workflow`. The human approves the scope and readiness at entry, then owns the final review; autoloop implements each phase, reviews it, repairs once after a failure, and advances or stops.

This is a coarser gate, not a removed one. The human approves the scope and reviews the result; what changes is how much work accumulates in between. State that distinction at entry.

### What the human gives up

Interim reviews use the same inherited model that wrote the code, so they are a **fast filter, not an independent check**. Autoloop deliberately stops before final review so the human can run that review separately, ideally on a different model. Interim PASSes do not replace it.

## The helper

All loop state goes through the helper. Do not edit `loop-state.json` directly.

The exit code carries the verdict — `0` clean, `1` hard block, `3` succeeded with a finding worth reading, `127` not found. Every command can return findings, not just `start`: check them on every call, including `status`, `log`, and `loop`. Most are fine to proceed past once read; a few mean a field in the same result (like `start review --loop`'s `diff`) was computed from something wrong or stale, and using it without acting on the finding first would hand the spawned agent bad input.

- `status`/`start` print their real payload on success
- `log` and `loop`'s lifecycle actions (other than `--start`) print `{}` on success.

If `qrspi-x` is not found (exit 127), direct the human to the local helper build in the runtime contract; after the package is published, `npm i -g @ebullient/qrspi-x` is also an option. Autoloop cannot run unattended without it — this is a hard stop, not a degrade-and-continue case.

## Entry gate

Verify fresh-context delegation is available before starting loop state.

Run `status`. If `loop` is present and `next.action` is not `done`, a loop already exists: go to **Resuming** instead.

Agree the run with the human:

- **Scope** — a single phase or all remaining phases. Default to a single phase if unstated; all-phases is the larger commitment and should be chosen deliberately. The helper takes this as a selector: `all`, one phase id (`3`), a range (`2..4`), or a comma list (`1,3`).
- **What it will do unattended** — implement and commit each phase (one commit per step — not a choice; the strongest resume evidence for a run with no human watching), review each phase, and repair once on failure.
- **What it will not do** — run the final review.

Then run `loop start <selector> --feature <feature> --project <path>`. It runs the helper's entry checks and resolves the scope, adding any incomplete phases the selection depends on. If it refuses, it wrote nothing: each finding's message says what is wrong and usually how to fix it, so work through them with the human and run it again.

Once it succeeds, nothing has been spawned yet. Show the human the resolved `phaseIds` and wait for a clear yes. An explicit prior authorization covering these resolved phases satisfies this gate; do not ask again for the same scope. Any added dependency outside that authorization still needs approval. If the human rejects the scope, run `loop abandon "<reason>" --feature <feature> --project <path>` and start over with a different selector.

## Revision checks and evidence

At entry and resume, validate Spec/Plan input provenance and recover human approval covering their exact revisions and resolved phases. Supply the complete runtime contract and approved revision identifiers to every role. Before each spawn and before logging/advancing, verify those revisions still match (normalizing progress markers only). Missing or stale inputs stop the loop through `loop stop "<revision/evidence gap>" --feature <feature> --project <path>` and hand back; do not change helper state or silently refresh digests.

Persist implementer verification reports verbatim under `./.qrspi/<feature>/verification/` with unique attempt filenames; keep step/criterion IDs, commands, actual outcomes, spec digest and source/commit evidence. Never forward these reports as claimed tests to the reviewer. Recovered completion requires that evidence as well as markers/commits; missing evidence must be recovered by independent checks in a fresh context or handed back, not reconstructed as successful results.

Before `log review` and `advance`, compare the review's `## Scope` snapshot with current scoped inputs. Fingerprint source/diff data without returning heavy reads to the orchestrator; use a fresh verifier when needed. Read snapshot metadata as well as verdict/findings. A stale completed review is historical: stop for reassessment instead of overwriting its label or treating helper idempotence as freshness. An unchanged completed review may be recovered and logged without spawning another reviewer. Planned subsequent phases have separate snapshots and do not turn a phase PASS into final integration approval.

Use the runtime decision summary at entry and handback, including affected criteria, actual verification, accumulated conditions, revisions, and the precise decision for the human.

## Loop state

The helper owns `loop-state.json` for as long as a loop is running; `status` reports it under the top-level `loop` key (`scope`, `phaseIds`, `cycle`, `phaseId`, `checkpoint`, `conditions`, `stoppedReason`) — absent entirely once no loop is running. `loop.checkpoint` is only the **most recent** checkpoint and `loop.conditions` only the **currently open** ones, not the full run history; that full history is durably recorded in `history.jsonl` as each `log review` call happens, and survives after `loop-state.json` is deleted when the loop ends. Read it back with `history read --kind review` — see **Handing back**.

Each spawn is bracketed: `start <task> --loop` **before** spawning, `log <task>` after the agent returns. `start ... --loop` writes the pre-spawn intent to `loop-state.json` before anything runs, so a session that dies mid-spawn leaves that behind rather than what it last finished — a retried `start ... --loop` reads it back instead of starting over. `log <task>` reads the agent's output from disk — phase markers, commits, the review artifact — and records the outcome; it does not trust the agent's report.

## The loop

Before starting a loop, verify that fresh-context delegation is available. Before each implementation or repair spawn, read [the Implementer role](references/implementer.md); before each review or re-review spawn, read [the Reviewer role](references/reviewer.md). Launch a **new subagent with no inherited conversation history**, supplying the full role and only its listed task inputs plus the project root. A repair receives the failed review path as evidence; a reviewer receives spec/plan paths and exact diff scope, never an implementer report or rationale. Named-agent registration is optional and does not establish isolation.

Use new agents for each phase, repair, review, and re-review. If fresh contexts become unavailable mid-loop, record `loop stop "Fresh-context delegation unavailable" --feature <feature> --project <path>` and hand back. Do not continue in the parent conversation or reuse a context containing implementation reasoning.

Drive the loop from the helper. Run `status` and act on `next.action`, then run `status` again, until the action is `done`, `stop`, or `acknowledge-required`.

If `start implement --loop`/`start review --loop` reports the phase's base as stale or missing (e.g. a human fixed a FAIL by hand mid-run), determine the correct base — current HEAD is a reasonable default — and retry the same call with `--base <commit-ish>`. Ask the human if you aren't sure.

### `implement`

Run `start implement --phase <phaseId> --loop --feature <feature> --project <path>`. The result carries `phaseId`.

```
Spawn a fresh-context subagent with references/implementer.md for feature: <feature-name>
Mode: phase
Phase: <phaseId>
```

When it returns:
- If completed, run `log implement --phase <phaseId> --feature <feature> --project <path>`. 
- If STOPPED, run `loop stop "<its Stopped because paragraph>" --feature <feature> --project <path>` (see **`stop`, `acknowledge-required`, or `done`**, below) — one call records the stop in both `loop-state.json` and `history.jsonl`, so the reason stays durable even after the loop ends. Do not retry a stopped implementer.

### `review` or `re-review`

Run `start review --phase <phaseId> --loop --feature <feature> --project <path>`. The result carries the checkpoint `label` and the phase `diff` command. Use them exactly; never compose a label — the reviewer stops rather than overwrite a finished review, which would strand the loop.

If `./.qrspi/<feature>/reviews/<label>.md` already contains a completed verdict for this recorded checkpoint, validate its snapshot and completion evidence, then recover through `log review` without spawning a reviewer. If stale or incomplete, stop and hand back. Otherwise, if the file is absent, create it containing exactly `## Verdict: PENDING`; leave an existing PENDING stub alone. Spawn only for an absent/pending review. The reviewer overwrites the stub but refuses a completed artifact.

```
Spawn a fresh-context subagent with references/reviewer.md for feature: <feature-name>
Diff: <diff>
Phase: <phaseId>
Label: <label>
```

Do not spawn the explainer; it is an opt-in aid for a human who is present.

If the reviewer returns STOPPED, run `loop stop "<reason>" --feature <feature> --project <path>` and hand back without logging a verdict. Otherwise, when it returns, run `log review --label <label> --feature <feature> --project <path>`: the helper reads the verdict from the artifact and that becomes the next `next.action` on your following `status` call. Conditions never trigger a repair; they are reported at the end.

### `repair`

Run `start repair --phase <phaseId> --loop --feature <feature> --project <path>`. This consumes the phase's one repair attempt before the agent runs, so a crash cannot buy a second one. The result's `review` is the failed review's path relative to `./.qrspi/<feature>/`.

```
Spawn a fresh-context subagent with references/implementer.md for feature: <feature-name>
Mode: repair
Phase: <phaseId>
Review: ./.qrspi/<feature>/<review>
```

When it returns:
- If completed, run `log implement --phase <phaseId> --feature <feature> --project <path>` (or `log repair` — same call, either name accepted).
- If STOPPED, run `loop stop "<reason>" --feature <feature> --project <path>`, as above.

### `advance`

Mark the finished phase `[x]` in `plan.md`, then run `loop advance --feature <feature> --project <path>`. The helper moves to the next phase in scope, or marks the loop `done` when the scope is complete.

### `stop`, `acknowledge-required`, or `done`

Go to **Handing back**. If the helper returns an action it has not listed here, stop and hand back rather than guess.

## Context discipline

Do not read source files, run diffs, or read review artifacts beyond snapshot metadata, the verdict and findings table. Put every heavy read in a subagent. The orchestrator holds only scope, verdicts, and state so it can survive to the end of the run.

## Resuming

Run `status`. If there is no `loop` key, this is not a resumable autoloop run; start from the entry gate.

Otherwise dispatch on `next.action` exactly as in **The loop**. `start ... --loop` and `log <task>` are both idempotent, keyed by actual on-disk state — a relaunch after a crash re-reads `inFlight` from `loop-state.json` and the real evidence on disk (phase markers, commits, the review artifact), and produces the same result a continuing session would have: an interrupted implementer's retried `start implement --loop` returns the same phase rather than a fresh one; a review action reuses its recorded label and any PENDING stub.

If the action is `acknowledge-required`, the loop is stopped (`loop.stoppedReason`) or has open conditions. Report them and wait for the human; do not resume past them. After the human has acted — fixed the problem, written a verdict into a leftover PENDING stub, or relaunched it themselves — run `loop ok "<what they did>" --feature <feature> --project <path>` and continue from its `action` field; the same call also records the resolution durably in `history.jsonl`. If the human wants to end the run instead, run `loop abandon "<reason>" --feature <feature> --project <path>`.

## Handing back

Stop and report. Do not run the final review, create a PR, or clean up artifacts.

Report:
1. **Outcome** — completed in full, or stopped (and why, from `status`'s `loop.stoppedReason`).
2. **Phases completed**, with each review label and verdict — run `history read --kind review --feature <feature> --project <path>` for the full trail (`loop.checkpoint`, if a loop is still active, only ever holds the single latest one) and report the entries for this run's phases.
3. **Accumulated conditions** from `status`'s `loop.conditions` (while the loop is still active) or from the `history read --kind review` trail's `conditions` fields (once it has ended) — every non-blocking finding the loop advanced past, grouped by phase. These were never fixed; they are the human's to triage.
4. **Where it stopped**, if it stopped: the phase, the cycle, the blocker, and the relevant review artifact path.
5. **What's next** — the final review, run by the human, ideally on a different model than this session used.

Commits are one per step, plus one per repair — no commit-mode choice, this is the only shape an unattended run produces. Offer to squash before the final review, every run, but do not squash unasked — the commits are the record of what the loop did, and they are the only way to see where a phase went wrong until the human chooses to collapse them.
